description: Design, initialize, audit, migrate, maintain, or evaluate a packaged Codex or Claude Code plugin's shared Skills, route ownership, manifests, marketplace wrappers, hooks, and version-bound compatibility evidence. Use only for explicit packaged agent-plugin architecture work. Do not use for repository-local AGENTS.md or .agents/skills systems, ordinary source-code or documentation work merely because it is in a plugin repository, host installation, publication, deployment, or Git submission. When architecture and installation or deployment are mutually exclusive alternatives, ask one concise clarification before routing and keep the workflow unselected until the user chooses; delegated choice or current execution limits do not resolve the scope difference.

# Agent Plugin Architect

Design or audit the smallest coherent packaged-plugin control plane for Codex
and Claude Code. Treat Codex as the first-class target and preserve a single
shared Skill tree when both hosts can discover it without weakening Codex.

## Route The Work

1. For an unresolved choice between mutually exclusive workflows with material
   differences in route ownership, write surfaces, persistent metadata or
   authority, ask one clear question and keep the workflow unselected until the
   user chooses. You may explain unavailable actions, but read-only authority,
   lower risk, lighter work or current feasibility cannot justify defaulting to
   one option, proceeding with it, or requiring the user to object to stop.
   Explicit architecture requests continue below; explicit installation stays
   with its owner, explaining unavailable authority without substituting an
   architecture audit. Conceptual comparisons and choices without material
   boundary differences do not require this gate. After selection, do not
   reconfirm unchanged conditions; ask only for necessary missing input or a
   material conflict.

   Confirm that the selected request explicitly concerns packaged agent-plugin
   architecture. Repo-local `AGENTS.md` or `.agents/skills` work belongs to
   `agents-architect`; ordinary plugin code or documentation has no Axiom
   route solely because it lives in a plugin repository.
2. Inventory the package before editing. Read
   `references/package-inventory.md`.
3. For a read-only audit of one packaged release candidate, read
   `references/release-readiness.md`. It classifies impact, version and runtime
   identity, local and remote evidence, and the one next decision, then stops
   before every mutation phase.
4. Define route ownership and trigger boundaries with
   `references/route-and-trigger-contracts.md`.
5. For shared Skill structure and direct discovery, read
   `references/packaged-skill-architecture.md`.
6. For startup hooks, untrusted content, credentials, or runtime effects, read
   `references/hooks-and-trust-boundaries.md`.
7. For manifests, wrappers, and Codex/Claude Code parity, read
   `references/cross-host-packaging.md`.
8. For routing cases, context cost, or host observations, read
   `references/evaluation-and-evidence.md`.
9. Before completion, read `references/validation-reporting.md`.

Load only references needed for the active phase. A request may compose this
route with at most one other Axiom route when both contracts are independently
necessary. An explicit usage-cost goal may add `optimize-codex-usage`;
retrospective review may add `review-axiom-task`. Git submission, installation,
publication, deployment, and consequential external effects remain separate
active phases and select their owning route instead of inheriting authority
from this Skill.

## Deliverable

Return the package inventory, route and trust decisions, changed surfaces,
validation evidence, compatibility class, and every host or lifecycle check
that is `NOT-RUN` or `UNAVAILABLE`. File presence and static parity are not
host execution evidence.
